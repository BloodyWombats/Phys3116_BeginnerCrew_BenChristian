# Faber-Jackson relation with SAMI DR3

This repository explores the **Faber-Jackson relation** using data from the **SAMI Galaxy Survey (DR3)** and the GAMA input catalogues. The goal is to reproduce and compare the scaling relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion, and identify the difference between this and the classic literature value
